Binary Tree|A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children. Typically the child nodes are called a "left" pointer, a "right" pointer. The "root" pointer points to the topmost node in the tree. The left and right pointers recursively point to smaller "subtrees" on either side. One common use of binary trees is binary search trees; another is binary heaps.|Labautopedia|http://www.labautopedia.org/mw/List_of_programming_and_computer_science_terms
Class|Class, in the context of object oriented computer language, is the prototype for an object in an object-oriented language; analogous to a derived type in a procedural language.
